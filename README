redokast is a podcast encoding and web page generation system using apenwarr's implementation of djb's redo.

Besides redo, it needs oggenc, vorbiscomment (both from vorbistools), date, grep (from GNU coreutils), lame, id3v2, pv, python 2.x and python-requests.

Try “redo” to see how everything gets build.

Included is a rudimentary upload skript, which will only work if you happen to have the password to <ftp://dieweltistgarnichtso.net> in a .netrc file.
